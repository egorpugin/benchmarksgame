;;; Derived from the Chicken variant by Sven Hartrumpf
;;; contributed by Matthew Flatt
;;; *reset*
;;; improved by Phil Nguyen:
;;; - use `cons` instead of struct `node`
;;; - remove the confirmed unneccessary field `val`
;;; - accumulate part of `check`
;;; - use unsafe accessors and fixnum arithmetics
;;; - clean up with `define` instead of nested `let`
;;; - clean up with `for/sum` instead of `for/fold`
;;; Parallelized by Gustavo Massaccesi, 2019
